# Overview

This repository contains the working paper "Center-Outward R-Estimation for Semiparametric VARMA Models", 2020, Marc Hallin, Davide La Vecchia and Hang Liu. 
The repository contains R codes for computing center-outward rank- and sign-based central sequences (based on the van der Waerden, Spearman and sign scores) 
for VAR(1) models. The R codes also give examples showing how to obtain the QMLE and R-estimators under various error distributions, 
how to compute bias and MSE and generate their boxplots.
